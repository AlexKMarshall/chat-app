# HAL-9000 Chatbot

This app is chat-bot for you to discuss matters of great importance with [HAL-9000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000) from [2001: A Space Odyssey](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)>).
The HAL-9000 Chatbot is a UI proof of concept, and doesn't contain a real AI. He means you no harm, Dave.

I created it as my application submission for [Codeworks](https://codeworks.me/) bootcamp programme.

[See it in action here](https://alexkmarshall.github.io/hal-9000-chatbot/)

## Getting Started

The app is made with vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript. You can run it locally by cloning the repo and opening index.html.

## Features

- You can talk with HAL-9000. Send him a message and see what he has to say. His responses are limited to lines from
  the film, so don't worry if he seems a little confused.
- The app is responsive and you can use it on your mobile just fine, as well as on desktop.
- The app runs locally in the browser, and doesn't store your information or send messages to a server.
  HAL-9000 knows how to keep a secret. But if you close your browser, he won't remember anything you said.
